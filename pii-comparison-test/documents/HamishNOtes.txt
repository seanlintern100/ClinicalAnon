Date: 18 December 2025
Duration: 90 min
 
Medical/Treatment Plan
Admission plan:
•	Hamish to be admitted to Hawera Hospital after Christmas fro Methadone switch – communicated by Dr Larry in recent meeting with him
•	Admitted for monitoring
•	Will transition to methadone
•	Expected 3 weeks on ward; Hamish can have day leave
•	Jason present for appointment
•	Unsure of Dr Larry's background/specialty
•	Waiting for Landi to return from sick leave. Dr Larry was filling in
Medication management:
•	Sounds like Hamish has recently self-managed his meds, which led to getting 2 days ahead
•	Mary going away today – only giving his dad one day's worth and taking the rest with her to prevent similar issue occuring
 
Risk/Clinical Concerns
Christmas is a difficult time. Hamish aware that little gets done from a medical standpoint over the holiday period.
Key statement: Agreement to transition to methadone should address immediate risk over Christmas, but Hamish says if this doesn't work, he doesn't want to go through another year like this. Does not want to wait past January.
 
Coping & Positive Activities
Current strategies:
•	Keeping mind busy
•	Making keychains (doesn't hurt his body)
•	Doing something different each week – initiated by Mary (e.g., beach, taking photos for Fiso, fish and chips)
Positive plans for Christmas period:
•	Got the dog
•	Mate from Hawke's Bay visiting 26th to New Year's
•	Mary taking him out weekly
•	Set up dart board
Family: Mum and dad here over Christmas time

Record of the session
30 minute meeting with Peter (habit), Kevin (OT at OT Works)  and Sarah (Pain specialist) RE Hamish. All agreed that supporting Hamish to access AOD is the appropriate course noting:
•	 that Hamish may need support during transition phase as can experience pain flare ups.
•	We should connect with AOD to suggest a team meeting or individual catch ups prior to their involvement o give them background on Hamish and the work we are doing.
I have also shared safety plan for Hamish with Peter, Jason and Kevinn.
Note that Sarah suggested Hamish experience opiod anlygesisa where the level of pain meds may actually be increasing his experience of pain curnrely.

To DO
•	Call Roby to clarify that the appointment on 12/12 is actually to get a referral to AOD – otherwise email Landi and others to confirm how Mary initiates this – will need to go through a GP
•	Update safety plan when next see Hamish
•	Consider supports yto be put in place while Hamish is transitioning meds – discuss with Jane

Email from Kevinn:
Hi Peter, Jason and Sean

Just to re-cap the meeting today, and possibly frame an email to Jane.

1.	Hamish is meeting with a GP at his medical centre 12/12/25 to discuss or complete the referral process to A&D services. This may be a good opportunity to pass along any information or messages the A&D Team may find useful. Jason has kindly offered to attend this appointment with Hamish, following Hamish’s consent. Obviously, Hamish’s consent to liaise with the A&D team is needed also, prior to passing along any information. Peter- Do we need to get this in writing from Hamish?
2.	Pre, During and Post A&D team assessment: it would be good to have a plan in place, that could be implemented at a moment’s notice, in view of the likely withdrawal symptoms Hamish may experience and the support he (and Mary) are likely to need. Wesley House may be an option, and would need support from ACC to fund. Peter – are we able to check this with Jane, and find out how much ‘notice’ this option, or similar, would need?
3.	Birthday and Christmas period: from previous years, the month of December can be somewhat ‘triggering’ for Hamish, as he seems to reflect on his life and what he has (or hasn’t) achieved. Is this a suitable time to be offering respite to him and the family? Is this something that ACC would consider funding, especially if there is a wait on the A&D input? If there is no support from ACC to fund anything, devising a plan to have on hand would be worthwhile. Peter – again questions for Jane; but we need to highlight the need is around managing Hamish’s expectations of the A&D input, the timeframes expected, and the likelihood of suicide ideation during December.

Sean – while we await a response from Jane to our questions, are you able to put together a Safety Plan with Hamish next time you see him, for all of us to use if we need too?

Lastly, are we able to convey Sarah’s statement regarding the overall lack of in-patient medication programmes to ACC. It may be falling on ‘deaf ears’, but who knows….!

PC to Mary to get an update on Hamish and confirm next meeting time. Mary confirms that Hamish was no accepted into either inpatient pain services. She says that Hamish is disappointed and wanting to confirm some change before Christmas. She says that Hamish and her are keen to explore AOD approach. She attempted to contact AOD directly but was re-directed back to GP to make referral.

Mary noted possible elevated risk for Hamish over Christmas siting this pattern over the last 2 years. Confirmed I will meet with Hamish in 2 weeks time

Group meeting with Sarah Murray (pain Specialist), Jane (ACC), Landi (GP), Peter (TBI Health) to discuss support for Hamish. Most of meeting focused on medication regime and how to 1. Switch to methadone and 2. Then look to reduce amount of meds.

Sarah clear that this is addition and Hamish=’s pain is not explained by physical injuries saying opioids are now causing more pain than being off them. Noting Opioid induced hyperalgesia

Landi noted that if Hamish is treated for drug addiction he would not need to come off existing meds to transition methadone.

Peter agreed to set up next meeting following the inpatient assessment I late Nov.

Note
Record of the session
Met with Landi (Hamish’s new GP) for half an hour today:

•	Will not be returning to Tom – decision made; hold off on telling Hamish for now.
•	Stick with Landi as the primary GP moving forward.
•	Pamma identified as another GP involved.
 
Concerns Raised
•	Early repeat prescription requests flagged as a significant concern. However Hamish has not been requesting addition for the last 2 months/
•	Tom was not following clinic policy, which needed addressing.
 
Other
•	Non-palliative patient – requires appropriate management.
•	Turps mentioned as res treatment – thinking this would be months not weeks
•	 
Clinical Management
•	Deferral to Dr Murray for further input.
•	To initiate methadone treatment, Hamish must reduce other medications to ease withdrawal between doses. Unless goes additions route who are more tolerant of other meds in system
•	Methadone switch options:
o	Inpatient: would require several months.
o	Outpatient: alternative approach.
•	AOD (Alcohol and Other Drugs) pathway: may allow less reduction of other medications.

Also responded to email from Landi:
Kia ora Landi,
Thanks for getting back to me. I've sent through a Teams invite for Thursday 23rd October at 1:30 p.m. – please let me know if that needs to be changed.
In terms of the relationship between Hamish and his mum, I don't believe there's any risk of physical harm. However, Hamish does swear and become verbally abusive when he wants medication and Mary refuses. This does have an impact on her wellbeing. We've tried different strategies over the years to manage this including considering having the meds managed by an external service and getting Hamish’s dad in giving the meds.
Currently, Mary manages the situation by giving Hamish more control over when he takes his medication. She'll occasionally provide extra medication at certain times in a measured way, even if this means running out before the end of the week. This approach has actually improved their relationship – it's much better now than it was in the past when Hamish would demand and receive medication more frequently, which led to him running out more often. Obviously this approach causes issues for Hamish when he runs short of medication – I understand this is usually about 24 hours prior to his new script being due.
We have considered with ACC having an external agency manage his medications. The main blockers were difficulty finding a service that could come in multiple times throughout the day, and the fact that Mary is currently paid by ACC to manage the medications. Losing this payment wasn't ideal for her, though I think she would have agreed to it if we could have found an appropriate agency, as it would reduce the conflict with Hamish.
I understand from Jane Cleaver (ACC Recovery Partner) that she had made a referral to TARPS in Auckland, which is an inpatient pain specialist unit, and is also considering Wesley House as a service that could support Hamish while there are changes to medications being managed. Are you able to clarify if this is your understanding and how involved you would be in either option?
Also, can you clarify Dr Sarah Murray's role and whether it is ongoing or not? I'm keen to bring together an MDT, but wanting to understand roles first as there have been significant changes in Hamish's specialist team recently.
Looking forward to speaking more on Thursday.

EMAIL Sent 14/10/25


Kia ora Landi,
Thank you for your email. I'm writing to introduce myself as I've been working with Hamish for the past two years as his psychologist. I think it would be really valuable for us to connect before your appointment with him in two weeks.
My work with Hamish has focused primarily on his depression and ongoing suicidality. He's someone who's been living with significant chronic pain following his chest injury, and it genuinely restricts his life. When his pain is better managed, he's more active, his mood is better, and he engages more. When it's not, everything deteriorates — his activity drops, his mood worsens, and his sense of hopelessness increases. There's definitely a tendency for him to see pain medication as the solution to everything, and I've been working with him on developing other management strategies. Hopefully the inpatient pain clinic referral comes through and we can get better clarity on what's actually going on and what the options are.
I met with Hamish today, and while his mood is broadly better than it was earlier this year, one of the pressing issues at the moment is poor sleep. This isn't new, but it's really front of mind for him right now. He's currently taking his 1 a.m. oxycodone dose around midnight and then often waking at 4–5 a.m. wanting more medication. He's mentioned that sleep was noticeably better when quetiapine was at 300 mg previously. I think if we can get his sleep under better control, it would help reduce his overnight pain medication use, improve his overall mood, and reduce his pain perception. While I'll continue working with him on psychological strategies around sleep, I'm wondering whether there might be some medical options worth considering as well.
I know you've identified concerns around him running out of medication early — this is an ongoing pattern, and I think it's at least partly being driven by the need to take additional medication at night when he can't sleep. When he does run out, he vomits and goes into withdrawal, which is obviously not what anyone wants. The goal is to keep him within his prescribed limits, and better sleep management might be a practical way to help with that.
We have a detailed safety plan that's been developed over the past two years, and I'd welcome your input into that as we coordinate his care. One thing I hadn't previously considered but wondered about after reading your email is whether naloxone might be useful from a risk management perspective. I can discuss more with you about the current protocols Mary has in place around managing Hamish's access to medication and the safety mechanisms already in place.
I'm also following up with ACC this week regarding timing for the inpatient pain service referral and will keep you updated.
I'd really like to suggest that we meet before your appointment with Hamish. It would give me a chance to provide some background, answer any questions you have, and make sure we're on the same page. Following that, we could look at organizing a broader MDT meeting, probably after you've had your first review with him.
I'm available for a phone call or to meet in person if that works better. Please let me know what suits you.
Ngā mihi,
Sean
